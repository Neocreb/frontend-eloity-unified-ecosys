# Cryptocurrency Integration Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the cryptocurrency functionality issues in the Eloity platform.

## Issues Identified

1. **Bybit API Integration**: The Bybit API keys were not properly configured
2. **Crypto Prices Not Showing**: The integration was falling back to mock data
3. **Deposit and Withdrawal Not Working**: Missing proper Bybit API integration

- Updated `.env.local` with Bybit API keys (secret key already updated)
- Created scripts to easily update API keys:
  - `update-bybit-keys.js` - Interactive script to update keys
  - `test-crypto-integration.js` - Comprehensive test script

### 2. Crypto Service Improvements
- **Enhanced `getCryptoPrices` function**:
  - Updated to use Bybit v5 API for better reliability
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Better fallback mechanism to CoinGecko API

- **Fixed `getOrderBook` function**:

  - Removed problematic dynamic imports that were causing type errors

### 3. Bybit Route Improvements

- Corrected import statements to work with the simple database utility
- Ensured proper syntax for database operations

## Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test-crypto-integration.js` - Tests all cryptocurrency functionality
- `test-bybit-integration.js` - Tests Bybit API connectivity

## Next Steps

1. **Provide Bybit API Keys**:
   - Obtain your Bybit Public API Key
   - Run `node update-bybit-keys.js` to update the keys in `.env.local`

2. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Cryptocurrency Functionality**:
   - Verify that crypto prices are showing real data
   - Test deposit address generation
   - Test withdrawal functionality
   - Verify trading page shows real crypto pairs and live trades

4. **Run Integration Tests**:
   ```bash
   node test-crypto-integration.js
   ```
