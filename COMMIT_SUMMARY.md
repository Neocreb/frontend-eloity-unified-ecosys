### Issue Resolution Confirmed

✅ **Migration Issue Fixed**
- The original error "No database URL set" has been resolved
- Migration script now properly loads environment variables
- Database migrations run successfully with real credentials

✅ **Security Maintained**
- Environment files properly ignored by .gitignore
- Sensitive credentials only stored locally in .env.local
- No real credentials committed to version control

✅ **Functionality Verified**
- All required environment variables properly set
- Database connection established and functional
- Application ready to use real data instead of mock data

### Next Steps

1. **Team Members**: Run `npm run setup:env` to initialize your local environment
2. **Development**: Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. **Verification**: Confirm that features now work with real data
4. **Future Updates**: Follow security best practices in all future commits

### Commands for Team Members

```bash
# Initialize your local environment
npm run init:env

# Get Supabase credentials
npm run get:supabase-credentials

# Test your environment configuration
npm run test:env

# Verify secure setup
npm run verify:setup

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### Security Reminders

- Never commit `.env.local` or any file containing real credentials
- Always use the deployment platform's environment variable management for production
- Regularly rotate your API keys and database passwords
- Monitor your Supabase project for unusual activity

The migration issue has been completely resolved while maintaining the highest security standards. The application should now be running with a fully functional Supabase backend instead of using mock data.
