<Dialog open={isOpen} onOpenChange={onClose}>
  <DialogContent>
    {/* Modal content */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>

// Convert to: Full-page component with header
<div className="flex flex-col h-screen bg-gray-50">
  {/* Header with back button */}
  <div className="sticky top-0 bg-white border-b p-4">
    <Button variant="ghost" onClick={() => navigate(-1)}>
      <ChevronLeft /> Back
    </Button>
  </div>
  {/* Page content */}
</div>
```

### Step 2: Update Parent Component
```typescript
// Before:  
const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);
<Button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>Open</Button>
<MyModal isOpen={showModal} onClose={() => setShowModal(false)} />

// After:
const navigate = useNavigate();
<Button onClick={() => navigate("/path/to/page")}>Open</Button>
```

### Step 3: Add Route to App.tsx
```typescript
import MyNewPage from "./pages/category/MyNewPage";

// In routes:
<Route path="category/my-new-page" element={<MyNewPage />} />
```

### Conversion Recommendations

**Completed This Session:**

  - **File**: `src/pages/search/UserSearch.tsx`
  - **Features**: Full-screen user search with typeahead, dark/light theme support, mobile-optimized
  - **Route**: Added to App.tsx at line 607
  - **Theme**: Full dark mode support with proper contrast and colors

- ✅ **FindUsersModal** → `/app/chat/find-users` (COMPLETED)
  - **File**: `src/pages/chat/FindUsers.tsx`
  - **Features**: Chat-focused user discovery with suggested users, full-screen layout
  - **Route**: Added to App.tsx at line 517
  - **Theme**: Full dark mode support with consistent styling

**Immediately Priority (Next Session):**
- [ ] **StoryViewerModal** - Core feature, high impact
- [ ] **ImageUploadModal** - Medium complexity, frequently used in chat
- [ ] **DeleteUserDialog** - Low complexity, important UX improvement

**Secondary Priority (Following Sessions):**
- [ ] **ImageUploadModal** - Medium complexity, frequently used
- [ ] **DeleteUserDialog** - Low complexity, important UX improvement
- [ ] **EnhancedShareDialog** - Medium complexity

**Note on Feed Modal Context-Dependency:**
The feed-related modals (CheckIn, Feeling, TagPeople, MediaUpload) are currently tightly integrated into CreatePostFlow with shared state. Converting these to full-page routes would require:
1. Extracting their state management from CreatePostFlow
2. Using navigation state or context to pass selected values back
3. Significantly refactoring the post creation flow

**Recommendation**: Keep these as modals OR create standalone pages with a different UX pattern (e.g., search/browse first, then navigate to create post with pre-filled data).

### Design Decisions:

- Feed/Stories modals (7 remaining)

## Notes

- Keep modal components as fallbacks during transition
- Add route parameters for context-specific pages (e.g., jobId, groupId)
- Consider using loaders for pre-fetching data
- Test browser back/forward behavior on all new pages
- **Important**: After creating a new page, search for all components using the old modal and update them to use navigation instead
