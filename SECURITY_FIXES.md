## Security Enhancements Added

### 1. NPM Configuration (.npmrc)
- Added audit-level configuration for moderate and above vulnerabilities
- Enabled package-lock for consistent dependency trees
- Configured secure registry settings

### 2. New Security Scripts
- `npm run audit:check` - Check for vulnerabilities
- `npm run audit:fix` - Automatically fix vulnerabilities
- `npm run audit:force` - Force fix (use with caution)
- `npm run security:update` - Update dependencies and fix audits

## Next Steps

### Once Node.js is installed, run these commands in order:

1. **Install updated dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Check for remaining vulnerabilities:**
   ```bash
   npm run audit:check
   ```

3. **Fix any remaining issues:**
   ```bash
   npm run audit:fix
   ```

4. **Update package-lock.json:**
   ```bash
   npm install --package-lock-only
   ```

### Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Weekly vulnerability checks:**
   ```bash
   npm run audit:check
   ```

2. **Monthly dependency updates:**
   ```bash
   npm run security:update
   ```

3. **Before production deployments:**
   ```bash
   npm audit --audit-level moderate
   ```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Dependency Pinning**: All major dependencies are pinned to specific secure versions
2. **Audit Configuration**: NPM audit level set to catch moderate and above vulnerabilities
3. **Regular Updates**: Automated scripts for dependency maintenance
4. **Security Headers**: Enhanced Helmet configuration for better protection
5. **Rate Limiting**: Improved rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Environment Security
