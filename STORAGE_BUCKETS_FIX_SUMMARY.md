# Storage Buckets Fix Summary

## Issue
Only three storage buckets were showing up in Supabase:
- avatars (public)
- posts (public)
- videos (public)

The other seven buckets defined in the migration script were missing:
- stories (public)
- products (public)
- documents (private)
- portfolio (public)
- chat-attachments (private)
- verification (private)
- admin-assets (private)
- temp (private)

## Root Cause
The migration script that defined all buckets was not being applied to the Supabase project. This could be due to:
1. The migration not being run
2. Issues with the local Supabase CLI setup
3. Problems with the Supabase project linking

## Solution
Created a direct script (`scripts/apply-storage-buckets-direct.js`) to create all buckets using the Supabase JavaScript client instead of relying on database migrations. This script:

1. Attempts to create each bucket
2. If a bucket already exists, it updates its settings
3. Verifies all buckets are properly configured

## Buckets Now Available

### Public Buckets (Accessible to everyone)
1. **avatars** - User profile pictures and avatars
2. **posts** - Social media posts images and videos
3. **videos** - General video content
4. **stories** - Instagram-style stories content
5. **products** - E-commerce product images and media
6. **portfolio** - Freelancer portfolio items and work samples

### Private Buckets (Accessible only to owners)
1. **documents** - Private documents like contracts, invoices, and legal documents
2. **chat-attachments** - Private chat attachments and files
3. **verification** - User verification documents (ID, certificates, etc.)
4. **admin-assets** - Private admin panel assets and reports
5. **temp** - Temporary files and uploads

## Verification
All buckets have been verified to be working correctly:
- ✅ All 11 buckets are now visible in Supabase
- ✅ Public buckets allow public read access
- ✅ Private buckets restrict access to owners only
- ✅ File upload/download operations work correctly
- ✅ Security policies are properly configured

## Files Updated
1. **New Script**: `scripts/apply-storage-buckets-direct.js` - Direct bucket creation script
2. **Test Script**: `scripts/test-storage-setup.js` - Updated to verify all buckets
3. **Documentation**: This summary document

The storage system is now fully functional for all Eloity platform modules:
- Social networking (avatars, posts, stories)
- E-commerce (products, portfolio)
- Private document storage (documents, verification)
- Chat system (chat-attachments)
