# React useLayoutEffect Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The application was throwing the following error:
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useLayoutEffect')
    at Object.useLayoutEffect (http://localhost:8080/node_modules/.vite/deps/chunk-ZMLY2J2T.js?v=c69501e1:1086:29)
    at FallbackThemeProvider (http://localhost:8080/src/contexts/SafeThemeProvider.tsx:22:9)
```

This error typically occurs in React applications when:
1. There are multiple instances of React being loaded
2. Server-side rendering issues with `useLayoutEffect`
3. Module resolution problems in the build system

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `SafeThemeProvider` component which was using `useEffect` but the error indicated that `useLayoutEffect` was null. This pointed to a React import or module resolution issue.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated SafeThemeProvider (`src/contexts/SafeThemeProvider.tsx`)

- Added explicit import of `useLayoutEffect` from React
- Implemented an isomorphic layout effect hook that safely falls back to `useEffect` on the server:

```typescript
// Use useEffect instead of useLayoutEffect on the server
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window !== "undefined" ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
```

- Replaced direct usage of `useEffect` with `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` in the `FallbackThemeProvider` component

### 2. Updated ThemeProvider (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)

- Added explicit `import React from "react";` to ensure proper React context
- Maintained all existing functionality while ensuring compatibility

### 3. Server Restart

- Terminated all existing Node.js processes
- Restarted the development server to clear any cached modules
- This resolved potential module resolution conflicts

## Why This Fixed the Issue

1. **Isomorphic Layout Effect**: The `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` pattern ensures that the correct React hook is used depending on the environment:
   - In browser environments: Uses `useLayoutEffect` for DOM manipulation before paint
   - In server environments: Falls back to `useEffect` to avoid SSR issues

2. **Module Resolution**: Restarting the development server cleared any cached or conflicting React instances that might have been causing the module resolution issue.

3. **Explicit Imports**: Adding explicit React imports ensures that the correct React instance is used throughout the application.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use the isomorphic layout effect pattern when using `useLayoutEffect` in components that might be rendered on the server
2. Ensure consistent React imports across the application
3. Regularly restart development servers to clear module caches
4. Check Vite configuration for proper React aliasing and deduplication

## Verification

After applying these fixes:
1. The development server starts without errors
2. The theme provider works correctly in both light and dark modes
3. No React hook-related errors appear in the console
4. The application functions as expected
