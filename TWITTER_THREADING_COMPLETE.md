## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Core Components Created**

1. **`PostDetail.tsx`** - Individual post page (like Twitter's post detail)
2. **`TwitterThreadedFeed.tsx`** - Main threaded feed view
3. **Enhanced `CommentSection.tsx`** - Image upload support
4. **Enhanced `PostCard.tsx`** - Clickable navigation

### **Routing System**
```typescript
// App.tsx route
<Route path="post/:postId" element={<PostDetail />} />

// Navigation from any post/comment
navigate(`/app/post/${postId}`);
```

### **Image Upload System**
```typescript
// Multiple image support
const [commentImages, setCommentImages] = useState<File[]>([]);

// Upload handler
const handleImageUpload = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const files = Array.from(event.target.files || []);
  setCommentImages(prev => [...prev, ...files].slice(0, 4));
};
```

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

### **Classic Mode (Default)**
1. User sees traditional feed with nested comments
2. Comment section supports image uploads
3. All existing functionality preserved

### **Threaded Mode (Twitter-Style)**
1. User clicks "Thread" tab to switch modes
2. Feed shows all posts with thread indicators
3. Clicking any post opens its detail page
4. Each reply can be clicked to become its own post
5. Always can navigate back to main thread

### **Navigation Pattern**
```
Main Feed → Click Post → Post Detail Page
                     ↓
              Click Reply → Reply Detail Page
                     ↓
              Click Reply → Another Reply Page
