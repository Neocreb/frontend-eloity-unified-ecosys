# Fix for Data Persistence Issues After Page Refresh

## Issues Identified
1. Images attached to posts are not visible after refresh
2. Likes disappear after refresh
3. Comments can't be added
4. Stories can't be posted

## Root Causes
1. **Service Worker Caching**: The service worker may be caching HTML responses for API endpoints, causing JSON parsing errors
2. **Real-time Subscription Issues**: Problems with Supabase real-time subscriptions preventing data updates
3. **Data Synchronization**: Inconsistent data synchronization between frontend and backend
4. **Storage Policy Issues**: Incorrect storage policies preventing proper data access

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Service Worker Fix
Updated [public/sw.js](file:///c:/Users/HP/.qoder/frontend-eloity-unified-ecosys-3/public/sw.js) to properly handle API requests:
- Added checks for JSON content types to bypass caching
- Ensured Supabase requests are not cached
- Improved handling of navigation vs API requests

### 2. Real-time Subscription Fix
Created [scripts/fix-realtime-subscriptions.js](file:///c:/Users/HP/.qoder/frontend-eloity-unified-ecosys-3/scripts/fix-realtime-subscriptions.js) to:
- Test and verify real-time connections
- Ensure proper subscription setup
- Check table accessibility

### 3. Storage Policy Verification
Verified and corrected storage policies:
- Ensured proper RLS policies for posts bucket
- Confirmed public read access with authenticated uploads
- Verified owner-based update/delete permissions

## How to Apply Fixes

### Step 1: Update Service Worker
The service worker has already been updated to properly handle API requests. To ensure the new version is used:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Unregister and re-register the service worker:
   - Open Developer Tools
   - Go to Application tab
   - Under Service Workers, click "Unregister"
   - Refresh the page

### Step 2: Run Real-time Subscription Fix
```bash
node scripts/fix-realtime-subscriptions.js
```

### Step 3: Verify Storage Policies
Ensure the storage policies are correctly applied by running the storage fix script:
```bash
node scripts/apply-posts-storage-fix.js
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Post Creation**:
   - Create a new post with an image
   - Verify the image is visible immediately
   - Refresh the page and verify the image is still visible

2. **Test Likes**:
   - Like a post
   - Verify the like count increases
   - Refresh the page and verify the like count persists

3. **Test Comments**:
   - Add a comment to a post
   - Verify the comment appears
   - Refresh the page and verify the comment persists

4. **Test Stories**:
   - Create a new story
   - Verify it appears in the stories section
   - Refresh the page and verify it persists

## Prevention for Future Issues

1. **Service Worker Best Practices**:
   - Always exclude API endpoints from caching
   - Use proper content-type checks
   - Test service worker behavior during development

2. **Real-time Subscription Management**:
   - Properly clean up subscriptions
   - Handle subscription errors gracefully
   - Test real-time functionality regularly

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Implement proper error handling for data operations
   - Use optimistic updates with rollback mechanisms
   - Ensure consistent data structures between frontend and backend

## Files Modified/Added

1. [public/sw.js](file:///c:/Users/HP/.qoder/frontend-eloity-unified-ecosys-3/public/sw.js) - Updated service worker with better API handling
2. [scripts/fix-realtime-subscriptions.js](file:///c:/Users/HP/.qoder/frontend-eloity-unified-ecosys-3/scripts/fix-realtime-subscriptions.js) - Script to fix real-time subscription issues
3. [fix-posts-storage-policies.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/.qoder/frontend-eloity-unified-ecosys-3/fix-posts-storage-policies.sql) - Storage policies (previously fixed)

## Expected Outcome

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Images attached to posts should persist after refresh
- ✅ Likes should persist after refresh
- ✅ Comments should be addable and persistent
- ✅ Stories should be postable and visible
- ✅ Real-time updates should work correctly
- ✅ No caching issues should occur
