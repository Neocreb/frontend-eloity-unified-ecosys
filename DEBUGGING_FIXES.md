# Debugging Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate State Declarations in EnhancedSettings.tsx ✅

**Problem**: Multiple duplicate state variable declarations causing TypeScript compilation errors:

- `cacheSize` declared twice (lines 301 and 311)
- `isLoading` declared twice
- `activeTab` declared twice
- `showKYCModal` declared twice
- `kycLevel` declared twice
- `showDeleteConfirm` declared twice

**Root Cause**: During my previous edits, I accidentally added duplicate state declarations when trying to add missing variables.

**Solution**: Consolidated all state declarations into a single, clean section:

```typescript
// Data & Storage
const [dataUsage, setDataUsage] = useState("unlimited");
const [autoBackup, setAutoBackup] = useState(true);
const [cacheSize, setCacheSize] = useState("245MB");

// UI states
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("profile");
const [showKYCModal, setShowKYCModal] = useState(false);
const [kycLevel, setKycLevel] = useState(user?.profile?.kyc_level || 0);
const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);
```

## Verification Steps

1. **TypeScript Check**: ✅ `npm run check` passed with no errors
2. **Build Test**: ✅ `npm run build` completed successfully
3. **Dev Server**: ✅ Running on port 5000 without crashes
4. **Proxy**: ✅ Proxy target http://localhost:5000/ responding correctly

## Current Status

- ✅ App is no longer in broken state
- ✅ Dev server running successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Build process working correctly
- ✅ All mobile fixes for video page and settings still intact

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/EnhancedSettings.tsx` - Removed duplicate state declarations

The application is now fully functional with all the mobile video and settings improvements working correctly.
