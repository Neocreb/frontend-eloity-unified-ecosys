  transactions,
  isLoading,
  error,
  refreshWallet,
  getTransactionsBySource,
  getTotalEarnings,
  getSourceBalance,
} = useWallet();
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```typescript
import UnifiedWalletDashboard from '@/components/wallet/UnifiedWalletDashboard';

function WalletPage() {
  return <UnifiedWalletDashboard />;
}
```

### Using Wallet Context

```typescript
import { WalletProvider, useWalletContext } from '@/contexts/WalletContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <WalletProvider>
      <YourAppComponents />
    </WalletProvider>
  );
}

function SomeComponent() {
  const { walletBalance, refreshWallet } = useWalletContext();
  // Use wallet data here
}
```

### Freelance Integration

```typescript
import FreelanceWalletCard from '@/components/wallet/FreelanceWalletCard';

function FreelancePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FreelanceWalletCard />
      {/* Other freelance components */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Styling

### Design System

- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Gradient backgrounds** for visual hierarchy
- **Icon-based navigation** with emojis
- **Consistent color coding** per income source:

  - Crypto: Orange gradient
  - Rewards: Purple gradient
  - Freelance: Indigo gradient

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where appropriate
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast color schemes

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Balance visibility toggle
- Secure API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without exposing sensitive data

### Transaction Safety

- Confirmation modals for all actions
- Amount limits and validation
- Bank account verification
- Transaction status tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- [ ] Real-time notifications for transactions
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Multi-currency support

### Integration Opportunities

- Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)

- Accounting software (QuickBooks)
- Tax preparation services

## Development Notes

### Mock Data

The system currently uses mock data for development but is designed to easily integrate with real APIs. All mock data is clearly marked and can be replaced with actual API calls.

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks to ensure the wallet remains functional even when some services are unavailable.

### Performance

- Lazy loading of transaction history
- Efficient state management with React Context
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Image optimization for icons and avatars

This unified wallet system provides a solid foundation for managing multiple income streams while maintaining excellent user experience and developer ergonomics.
