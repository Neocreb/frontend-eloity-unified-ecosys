### 2. Parent-Child Integration Strategy

#### **Route Organization**
```
Parent Routes (Existing):
â”œâ”€â”€ /app/freelance              # Main freelance hub
â”œâ”€â”€ /app/marketplace            # Main marketplace hub  
â”œâ”€â”€ /app/events                 # Main events hub
â””â”€â”€ /app/videos                 # Main videos hub

Detailed Routes (Integrated):
â”œâ”€â”€ /app/freelance/job/:jobId   # Job details within freelance section
â”œâ”€â”€ /app/marketplace/product/:productId # Product details within marketplace
â”œâ”€â”€ /app/events/:eventId        # Event details within events section
â””â”€â”€ /app/videos?tab=live&stream=:id # Live content within videos
```

#### **Data Flow Integration**
- **Jobs**: DetailedJobPage integrates with freelance system data
- **Products**: DetailedProductPage uses marketplace cart and checkout
- **Events**: DetailedEventPage integrates with events registration system
- **No Duplicate APIs**: All detailed pages use parent section APIs

#### **Functionality Sharing**
- **Shopping Cart**: Product pages use same cart as marketplace
- **Application System**: Job pages use same application flow as freelance
- **Event Registration**: Event pages use same RSVP system as events hub
- **User Profiles**: Freelancer pages use same profiles as freelance section

### 3. Unified Experience Features

    case 'job': navigate(`/app/freelance/job/${item.id}`);
    case 'event': navigate(`/app/events/${item.id}`);
    // ... other types
  }
};
```
