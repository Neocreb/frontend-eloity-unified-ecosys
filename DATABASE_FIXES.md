# Database Fixes Documentation

This document describes the database fixes applied to resolve issues with table relationships and permissions in the Eloity platform.

## Issues Resolved

1. **Stories Table Join Error**: `Could not find a relationship between 'stories' and 'user_id' in the schema cache`
2. **Profiles Table Permissions**: `permission denied for table profiles`
3. **Missing RLS Policies**: Tables lacked proper Row Level Security policies
4. **Network Connection Issues**: `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` for live_streams and battles endpoints

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Foreign Key Constraints
Added missing foreign key constraints to establish proper relationships:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "stories" 
ADD CONSTRAINT "stories_user_id_users_id_fk" 
FOREIGN KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "public"."users"("id") ON DELETE cascade ON UPDATE no action;
```

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)
Enabled RLS on key tables:
- stories
- profiles
- posts
- live_streams
- battles

### 3. Security Policies
Created basic policies for controlled access:
- SELECT policies for public read access
- INSERT/UPDATE policies with authentication checks

### 4. Permissions
Granted appropriate permissions:
- `SELECT` to `anon` role for read access
- `ALL` to `authenticated` role for full CRUD operations

### 5. Helper Views
Created views for easier data access:
- `stories_with_profiles`: Pre-joined stories with user profile data
- `posts_with_profiles`: Pre-joined posts with user profile data

## Verification

All fixes have been verified and are working correctly:
- ✅ Stories with profiles join
- ✅ Posts with profiles join
- ✅ Live streams query
- ✅ Battles query
- ✅ Helper views access

## Impact

These fixes resolve the frontend errors:
- `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` issues
- `400` errors for posts and stories tables
- `Could not find a relationship` errors for table joins
- `permission denied` errors for profiles table

The application should now function properly with all database operations.
