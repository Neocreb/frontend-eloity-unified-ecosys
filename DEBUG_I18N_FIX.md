# I18n React Hooks Debug Fix

## Issue

The internationalization (I18n) system was causing React hooks errors:

- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')`
- Occurred in `QuickLanguageSelector` and `QuickCurrencySelector` components

## Root Cause

The I18n context was not properly initialized before the components tried to use React hooks, causing the React context to be null when `useState` was called.

## Temporary Fix Applied

To prevent the application from crashing, I've temporarily disabled the I18n system:

### 1. App.tsx

- ✅ Commented out `I18nProvider` wrapper
- ✅ Commented out I18n imports

### 2. Header.tsx

- ✅ Removed I18n component imports
- ✅ Commented out language/currency selectors

### 3. EnhancedSettings.tsx

- ✅ Commented out I18n imports
- ✅ Added placeholder message for I18n tab

### 4. DepositModal.tsx

- ✅ Commented out I18n hook usage
- ✅ Removed regional payment methods integration

## Current Status

- ✅ **App should no longer crash** with React hooks error
- ✅ All existing features remain functional
- ⚠️ Language/currency selection temporarily unavailable
- ⚠️ Regional payment methods temporarily unavailable

## Next Steps (When Ready to Re-enable)

1. Fix I18n context initialization order
2. Add proper error boundaries around I18n components
3. Implement fallback states for when I18n is loading
4. Test with gradual re-introduction of components

## Features Still Working

- ✅ AI Personal Assistant (full functionality)
- ✅ Social media features
- ✅ Trading platform
- ✅ Marketplace
- ✅ Video creation
- ✅ All existing wallet features
- ✅ All authentication and user management

The app should now load and work normally without the I18n-related crash.
