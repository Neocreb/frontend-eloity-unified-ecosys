# Storage Permissions Error Resolution

## Error Details
```
ERROR: 42501: must be owner of table objects
```

## Cause
This error occurs when trying to execute the command:
```sql
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

In Supabase, the `storage.objects` table is managed by Supabase itself and users don't have ownership permissions to modify its structure. RLS is already enabled on Supabase storage tables by default, so this command is unnecessary and causes the permission error.

## Solution
The fix is simple - remove the problematic `ALTER TABLE` command from the SQL script. The updated [fix-posts-storage-policies.sql](file:///c:/Users/HP/.qoder/frontend-eloity-unified-ecosys-3/fix-posts-storage-policies.sql) file no longer contains this command.

## Updated SQL Script
The corrected script only includes:
1. Dropping existing policies (if any)
2. Creating new policies for the posts bucket
3. Refreshing the PostgREST schema cache

```sql
-- Drop existing policies on the posts bucket
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_public_read_posts" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_authenticated_upload_posts" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_owner_update_posts" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_owner_delete_posts" ON storage.objects;

-- Create proper policies for the posts bucket
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "allow_public_read_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
USING (bucket_id = 'posts');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "allow_authenticated_upload_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'posts' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow owners to update their own files
CREATE POLICY "allow_owner_update_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'posts' 
  AND owner_id = (auth.uid())::text
);

-- Allow owners to delete their own files
CREATE POLICY "allow_owner_delete_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'posts' 
  AND owner_id = (auth.uid())::text
);

-- Refresh the PostgREST schema cache
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

## How to Apply the Fix
1. Copy the updated SQL commands above
2. Paste them into the Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute the commands
4. Test the file upload functionality again

## Prevention
In the future, when working with Supabase storage policies:
- Do not try to alter the storage.objects table structure
- RLS is already enabled by default on Supabase storage tables
- Focus only on creating the appropriate policies for your use case
