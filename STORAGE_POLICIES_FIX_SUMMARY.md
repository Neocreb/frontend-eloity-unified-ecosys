# Storage Bucket RLS Policies Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Storage Upload Error**: `400 Bad Request` with "new row violates row-level security policy" when uploading to the posts storage bucket
2. **JavaScript Error**: `ReferenceError: user is not defined` in frontend code
3. **Accessibility Warning**: Missing `DialogTitle` for Radix UI Dialog component

## Root Cause

The primary issue was with the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the storage buckets. The existing policies were preventing authenticated users from uploading files to public buckets, even though they should be allowed to do so.

The error "new row violates row-level security policy" occurs when the INSERT operation fails the WITH CHECK condition in the RLS policy.

## Solution

Created comprehensive RLS policies for all storage buckets:

### Public Buckets (avatars, posts, videos, stories, products, portfolio)
- **Read**: Public access allowed
- **Write**: Authenticated users can upload
- **Update/Delete**: Only owners can modify their own files

### Private Buckets (documents, chat-attachments, verification, admin-assets, temp)
- **All Operations**: Only owners can access their own files

## Files Created

1. **Fix Script**: `fix-storage-policies.sql` - Direct SQL script to fix storage policies
2. **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20251026163000_fix_storage_policies.sql` - Migration script for proper database versioning
3. **Test Script**: `test-storage-policies-fix.cjs` - Script to verify the fix works correctly

## Policy Details

### Public Bucket Policies (Example for posts bucket)
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "allow_public_read_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
USING (bucket_id = 'posts');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "allow_authenticated_upload_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'posts' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow owners to update their own files
CREATE POLICY "allow_owner_update_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'posts' 
  AND owner_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Allow owners to delete their own files
CREATE POLICY "allow_owner_delete_posts" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'posts' 
  AND owner_id = auth.uid()
);
```

## Additional Issues

### JavaScript Error (`ReferenceError: user is not defined`)
This frontend error needs to be fixed in the application code where a `user` variable is being referenced but not properly defined.

### Accessibility Warning
The Radix UI Dialog component requires a `DialogTitle` for accessibility. This should be fixed by adding the appropriate title component or using the `VisuallyHidden` component as suggested in the warning.

## Verification

The fix has been tested and confirmed to resolve the storage upload issue. Authenticated users can now successfully upload files to public storage buckets.

## Deployment

Apply the migration script to update the database policies:
```bash
supabase migration up
```

After applying the fix, the storage upload functionality should work correctly without the RLS policy violation error.
