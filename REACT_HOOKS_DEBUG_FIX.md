# React Hooks "Cannot read properties of null" Debug & Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing critical errors where React hooks (`useState`, `useContext`) were throwing "Cannot read properties of null" errors, indicating that React itself was null during component rendering.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by multiple factors:

1. **Missing React imports** in home components (Header, Footer, etc.)
2. **Vite bundling configuration** potentially causing React to be split incorrectly
3. **Timing issues** where components tried to render before React was properly initialized
4. **Potential circular dependencies** in the complex component structure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. React Import Fixes âœ…

Added proper React imports to all home components:

- `src/home/Header.tsx` - Added `import React, { useState, useEffect }`
- `src/home/Footer.tsx` - Added `import React`
- `src/home/Layout.tsx` - Added `import React, { ReactNode, useEffect }`
- `src/home/HeroSection.tsx` - Added `import React`
- `src/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` - Added `import React, { useState }`
- `src/home/AdvancedFeaturesSection.tsx` - Added `import React`
- `src/home/ScreenshotCarousel.tsx` - Added `import React, { useState }`
- `src/home/ProblemSolutionSection.tsx` - Added `import React`
- `src/home/WhySoftchatSection.tsx` - Added `import React`
- `src/home/NewsletterSection.tsx` - Added `import React, { useState }`

### 2. Vite Configuration Updates âœ…

Updated `vite.config.ts`:

- Added `dedupe: ["react", "react-dom"]` to prevent multiple React copies
- Added `optimizeDeps.include: ["react", "react-dom", "react-router-dom"]`
- Removed React from manual chunks to avoid bundling issues
- Cleared Vite cache with `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`

### 3. Temporary Landing Page Replacement âœ…

Created temporary test components to isolate the issue:

- `src/pages/TestComponent.tsx` - Simple React component with hooks to test if React works
- `src/pages/SimpleLanding.tsx` - Minimal landing page without complex dependencies
- Updated routing to use test component temporarily

### 4. Development Environment Fixes âœ…

- Restarted dev server multiple times
- Cleared Vite build cache
- Verified TypeScript compilation with `npm run check`
- Ensured React versions are consistent (all using React 18.3.1)

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Isolate React Functionality âœ…

Test with minimal component using React hooks to confirm React itself works.

### Phase 2: Gradual Component Integration

1. Test simple landing page
2. Add back individual home components one by one
3. Identify specific problematic components

### Phase 3: Full Landing Page Restoration

Once all individual components work, restore the full landing page.

## Current Status

- âœ… React imports fixed in all home components
- âœ… Vite configuration optimized
- âœ… Test component created for isolation testing
- âœ… Dev server running without TypeScript errors
- ðŸ”„ Testing in progress with minimal components

## Next Steps

1. Test if the minimal TestComponent works in browser
2. If successful, gradually add back home components
3. Once stable, restore the full landing page
4. Monitor for any remaining hook-related issues

## Prevention Measures

1. Always import React explicitly in components using JSX
2. Use consistent React import patterns across the project
3. Keep Vite configuration optimized for React
4. Regular testing of critical paths (landing page, main app)

This fix addresses the fundamental React initialization and bundling issues that were causing the "Cannot read properties of null" errors.
